# Fluent-Python

本人学习 [Fluent-Python](<https://book.douban.com/subject/26278021/>) 的读书笔记，结合我的 Python 编程经验，记录了一些我认为重要的 Python 知识点（很多暂时用不到的知识点，没有学习）。

笔记想要传达出的思想和书的宗旨一样，致力于写出地道的 / 高效的 Python 代码（即 Fluent），仅此而已。

## PEP20 The Zen of Python

```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
